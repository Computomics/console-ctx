## Start Console service with TLS:

Copy your `public.crt` and `private.key` to `~/.console/certs`, then:

```sh
./console server
2021-01-19 02:36:08.893735 I | 2021/01/19 02:36:08 server.go:129: Serving console at http://[::]:9090
2021-01-19 02:36:08.893735 I | 2021/01/19 02:36:08 server.go:129: Serving console at https://[::]:9443
```

For advanced users, `console` has support for multiple certificates to service clients through multiple domains.

Following tree structure is expected for supporting multiple domains:

```sh
 certs/
  │
  ├─ public.crt
  ├─ private.key
  │
  ├─ example.com/
  │   │
  │   ├─ public.crt
  │   └─ private.key
  └─ foobar.org/
     │
     ├─ public.crt
     └─ private.key
  ...

```

## Connect Console to a Minio using TLS and a self-signed certificate

Copy the MinIO `ca.crt` under `~/.console/certs/CAs`, then:

```sh
export CONSOLE_MINIO_SERVER=https://localhost:9000
./console server
```

You can verify that the apis work by doing the request on `localhost:9090/api/v1/...`
