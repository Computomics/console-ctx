# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We always provide security updates for the [latest release](https://github.com/georgmangold/console/releases/latest).
Whenever there is a security update you just need to upgrade to the latest version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please use Githubs [private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) feature to report security bugs in [console](https://github.com/georgmangold/console) directly and privately to the maintainers.


Please, provide a detailed explanation of the issue. In particular, outline the type of the security
issue (DoS, authentication bypass, information disclose, ...) and the assumptions you're making (e.g. do
you need access credentials for a successful exploit).
